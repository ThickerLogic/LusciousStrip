# LusciousStrip
A simple python program that makes downloading and organizing mangas and albums from lu.scio.us a little easier.

HOW TO USE
  1. Go to luscious.net in Chrome. Other browsers may work, but haven't been tested.
  2. Select a manga you would like to download.
  3. If possible, change the view to "Blog Style."
  4. Scroll all the way to the bottom of this page. Larger albums with load pages on the fly, so keep scrolling.
  5. Right click any blank space on the page and select "Save As."
  6. Save the page as a complete webpage in the folder of your choice.
  7. Repeat steps 2-6 until you have all the managas you want downloaded.
  8. Copy the LusciousStrip.exe file into that folder and run it.
  9. Confirm a succesful copy and reformat.
  10. Delete the old Webpage files.

This is my first executable, so let me know if you find any bugs. You shouldn't need to have Python installed, so let me know if it's asking for it.

KNOWN ISSUES
* The program makes a blank folder in the new directory.
